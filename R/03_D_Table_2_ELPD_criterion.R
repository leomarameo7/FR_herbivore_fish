#### COMPARE MODELS ####
#'Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV, or LOO for short) and the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) are methods for estimating pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy from a fitted Bayesian model using the log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter values.
#'LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps.
#'Here weâ€™ll compare the models with the loo() function,

This will refit the model [n] times to compute the ELPDs for the problematic observations directly.

# moment_match = TRUE : Instead of refitting with MCMC, we can perform a faster moment matching correction to the importance sampling for the problematic observations. This can be done with the loo_moment_match() function in the loo package, which takes our existing loo object as input and modifies it.
