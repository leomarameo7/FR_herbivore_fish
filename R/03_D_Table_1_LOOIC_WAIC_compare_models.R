#### COMPARE MODELS ####
#'Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV, or LOO for short) and the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC)
#' are methods for estimating pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy from a fitted Bayesian model using 
#' the log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter values.
#'LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as 
#'AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps.
#'Here weâ€™ll compare the models with the loo_compare() function, 
# First by the LOO and then by the WAIC.
